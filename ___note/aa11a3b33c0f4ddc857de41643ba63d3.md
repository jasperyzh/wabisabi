Conversion rate optimization enables you to maximize every cent of your PPC spend by finding that sweet spot that convinces the maximum percentage of your prospects to take action.

But what is a good conversion rate? If you’re already achieving 3%, 5% or even 10% conversion rates, is that as high as you’re going to go? But what is a good conversion rate? Across industries, the average landing page conversion rate was 2.35%, yet the top 25% are converting at 5.31% or higher. Ideally, you want to break into the top 10% — these are the landing pages with conversion rates of 11.45% or higher.

## What is a Good Conversion Rate?
About 1/4 of all accounts have less than 1% conversion rates. The median was 2.35%, but the top 25% of accounts have twice that – 5.31% – or greater. Check out the far right red bar – the top 10% of Google Ads advertisers have account conversion rates of 11.45%.

You should be shooting for 10%, 20%, or even higher, putting your conversion rates 3x to 5x higher than the average conversion rate. Aspire to have these landing page conversion rate unicorns in your account.

### Conversion Rate by Industry

Even if the average conversion rates are lower in your industry, the top advertisers are outperforming you by 3-5x or more.

## 5 Ways to Increase Your Landing Page Conversion Rate
1. **Change the Offer**
Brainstorm, ask your customers, and come up with more unique offers to test. 
2. **Change the Flow**
Find the flow that works best for your prospects and use it to boost conversion rate and qualify your leads.
3. **Use Remarketing as a CRO Tool**
 Remarketing helps you get in front of these people with targeted, relevant messaging as they take part in other activities around the web, like email, watching YouTube videos, using social networks or searching for information.
4. **Try Out 10 Landing Pages to Find 1 Unicorn**
On average, you should be testing four unique landing pages – with varying offers, flow and messaging – to find that one awesome landing page.
5. **F%@# Conversion Rates**
Focus on landing page optimizations like the above that move you in the direction of higher quality, more qualified lead generation, not just more conversions.

## Key Takeaway
1. Most landing page optimizations are like moving around the deck chairs on the Titanic. Small changes = small gains.
2. Insanely focused and strategic landing page optimization brings 3-5x the conversions AND improves lead quality.
3. In some industries, even 5% conversion rates aren’t that impressive. If you’re stuck in the 2-5% conversion rate bucket, you have a ton of room to grow.
4. Get creative with your offers and test multiple different offers to find the one that resonates best with your audience. If you want to get really crazy (you know you do), find different offers that can help you qualify leads in the process.
5. Identify the obstacles keeping prospects from converting and get those roadblocks out of the way by changing the flow. Test different variations to find out exactly which path to conversion works best for your audience.
6. Use remarketing to recapture people who showed intent but didn’t convert.
7. Test smarter, not more often. You need to test 10 unique landing page variations to find 1 top performer, but this goes far beyond changing a font color and calling it a landing page variation.
8. Trim the fat in your account and ditch your lowest performers. Focus your energies on the top 10% of landing pages that earn 80% of traffic.
9. Always, always keep your eye on the prize, which is making more sales or generating leads most likely to convert to sales. Don’t let high conversion rates take precedence over lead quality or you’re going to spend more qualifying leads. You need to find the sweet spot where everything works like a well-oiled machine.
