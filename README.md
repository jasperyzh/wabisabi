# journal-log
create a json format for journaling, easy to encrypt and migrate

> ## 220110 - parallax halftone
> added parallax scrolling, easily adapted onto the page, should try it on fishermen website
>
> learnt from https://codepen.io/ericjacksonwood/pen/LbVKoa

> ## 220108 - basic-webform > mysql > datatables.js
> Finished implement the basic webform that insert into mysql, then found a non-jquery simple-datatables to display & export .csv
> manage to pull data from .CSV into SimpleDatatables

> ## 220104 - installed and run a few examples with puppeteer.js

> ## 211230 - Happy New Year Soon
> Started spring cleaning all my personal items, again. Compressing all my memories into a box, > that is more than enough for myself.
> 
> Cleaned up all my research papers, need to have a better focus organization, and actually > doing the work!
> “Listen to everyone, follow no one.” - Ultramarathoner, Dean Karnazes
> 211220 - New chapter, still the same, keep on learning
> Our kid was born a month ago, time flies for those unaware. Hectic, yet fulfilling as we learn > to live with our son. Enjoy life as it is. No rush, no fret.
> Aim at perfection (achievement, on Quality, striking thought pg117) 
> Aim at perfection in everything, though in most things it is unattainable; however, they who > aim at it, and persevere, will come much nearer to it than those whose laziness and > despondency make them give it up as unattainable.
> 211021 - Ass still on Fire
> Aim to clear all the clutter in life. Finish what I agreed to.
> One thing at a time. Steel my guts and deal with it.
> 
> Too bad I couldn't accompany Serene for the ultrasound to have a look at LittleYu.
> 
> Also momdad gave us the opportunity to move-in to the new condo unit they invested in, very > kind of them, but ultimately after 3 days of thinking, we rather remain the status quo.
> 
> Late evening we told mom that we prefer the status quo. She sound dejected.

> ## 210912 - Migrated everything into google docs/sheets
> A new workflow hit me just recently, having research documents separate from webdev blogs > would help to split up my work, and not be distracted by the constant need to perfect my codes.
> Hoping this would have me focus on the important job of achieving my goal, not simply coding > everything into a website.
> So currently my whole setup
> Htdocs - all webdev files and folder is under xampp folder
> Github - push all my working files onto github, act as a backup
> Google Drive - all researches, spreadsheet is on google cloud, easier for access and storage
> Projects/jobs files - saved on desktop and backup occasionally
> Important files - all saved in sd-card on the laptop, occasionally backup to harddisk

> ## 210830 - Test
> async/await, promises, callbacks
> JavaScript Callbacks, Promises, and Async / Await Explained

> ## 210815 - Penguin fly through the window: WSL
> 10x Developer? Forget that, just one thing at a time.
> Fireship taken the first place in my heart as one of the best webdev teacher on YouTube, been > going through plenty of knowledgeable videos on explaining things in quick succession with > pragmatic jokes inbetween. Also run through a tutorial on setting up WSL, basically running > both windows and linux at the same time, benefit in running linux tools and such, although I > still fresh and under utilizing linux atm.
> Web Development Setup Guide for Windows with Linux (WSL), a great guide on introducing me to > new tool, such as bashrc, zsh, how to install nvm/node/npm, git auth, git-cli and the linux SL > train.

> ## 210810 - Setting up for Database: MySQL Basic
> Data Data Data
> Went through a short tutorial on MySQL basic with Fireship. MySQL - The Basics
> Next up try out the library to pull data from MySQL with Javascript: https://sequelize.org/> master/

> ## 210806 - Form Validation with Vue
> A look into form validation
> Need a closer look at form validation with vue, using bootstrapcss. Need a good framework for > any future form workflow. Whether it send it data to MySQL or GoogleSheet, need to arm > ourselves fast.

> ## 210801 - Hilbert Curve & Maurer Rose
> Beautiful math at play
> Went through the tutorials by CodingTrain, Math is seriously beautiful and not boring. Wish > programming was taught to me since young... and I wondered at once point, how do I translate > all these to my kid lol.
> (Will link these in the future once I figure out the CMS for my site.)

> ## 210730 - Still on fire!
> Gotta remember to exercise too :x
> Completed double pendulum sketch today! also ran through fundamental for JS again, ?? is a new > operator I just learned, pretty neat. The files are falling into it place, I gonna keep this > going for sure!
> Gotta look into VueJS Intermediate workshop

> ## 210728 - Space Invader!
> Alien visited for moar
> Completed the space invader challenge with the coding train! Coding Challenge #5: Space > Invaders in JavaScript with p5.js.
> Looking for next challenge, either in MySQL or Socket.io. Let's try both!
> Manage to run a little chatroom, but lack the discipline to integrate using vue or typescript, > will get back to this later!

> ## 210727 - P5.js Setup
> Setup sketching stuff
> Setup P5.js and migrated the demo sketch from the starter template Using Parcel, TypeScript > with p5.js. Not using parcelJS, but still useful to know how to create the instances for p5js > and classes.
> Moved all sketches or experiements to JS-Playground, also discovered lazyload vue-router quirk > on classic JS: P5js cannot load with
> component: () => import(/* webpackChunkName: "js-playground" */ '../views/JsPlayground.vue')
> I might need to work on CMS/Blog/Database soon. Hardcoding blog is difficult.

> ## 210727 - TypeScript Mania
> Speed learning stuff
> Despite fatigue, speedrunning through the basic series for TypeScript tutorial, hopefully > build something simple after this. TypeScript Tutorial #18 - Generics, hopefully this helps > for the long run.

> ## 210725 - Just start building
> Already migrating project.
> NetNinja series on building Vue3 with typescript, migrating all the code over from the > previous setup. Vue 3 with TypeScript Tutorial.

> ## 210723 - Start doing some fixing in the gap
> I did a thing, again. Only this time, everything in this thing.
> (insert markdown) It's easy getting all conceit in my own capabilities, just living > day-to-day, pass the day doing minimal work. I have multiple attempts in getting myself into > routine to learn new stuff, but always fall shorts after several updates. This might turn out > the same, but I'm going to give this a try: working on this folder and solving whatever I need > using just this project. See how far I can go.
> For example this post right here, is done using hardcode via vuejs, and eventually I hope to > have this post generated through a proper API or CMS.
