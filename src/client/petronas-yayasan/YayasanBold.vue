            Sentuhan Ilmu Bridging the Online Learning Divide, or BOLD, is a
            comprehensive intervention programme under Yayasan PETRONAS with its
            implementation partner, MYReaders to address learning loss among
            high-needs students, caused by COVID-19. BOLD will provide 2,000
            high-needs children from B40 communities with Internet-enabled
            devices, digital modules, and devices and a structured learning
            support programme with volunteer tutors.
          </p>
          <p>
            The learning support programme is based on MYReadersâ€™ Literacy
            Toolkit which is set in the Malaysian context and structured to help
            children build up foundational skills step-by-step through Phonics,
            Reading Fluency, and Comprehension.
          </p>
          <p>
            To facilitate the learning support programme, a total of 1,600
            volunteer tutors will be recruited and trained to deliver one-to-one
            remediation remotely via WhatsApp using the MYReaders Literacy
            Toolkit that contains practical tools to provide effective literacy
            intervention.

            We are facing the biggest challenge in education and cannot just
            rely on schools to help our children. As individuals, we have a key
            role to play in helping these children gain foundational literacy
            effectively, through programmes which are structured and
            sustainable.
          </p>
          <p>
            Children from low-income communities are disproportionately affected
            by learning loss due to COVID- 19. We need to be particularly
            concerned for children who are now in their foundational years. For
            students who are in Year 3 this year, missing out on school for just
            three months may result in 72% of students falling so far behind
            that by Form 4 they may drop out or not be able to learn anything in
            school.
          </p>
          <p>
            As members of society, we need to act urgently and collectively to
            address the long-term negative effects of COVID-19 on Education.

            Sentuhan Ilmu Bridging the Online Learning Divide (BOLD) will
            provide 2,000 underprivileged students with internet-enabled digital
            devices to engage in remote or hybrid learning and assist students
            with immediate learning support.
          </p>
          <p>
            These actions will enable high needs students to participate in
            learning, catch up with their peers, and address learning losses
            caused by COVID-19 for a Malaysia where all students have equitable
            access to education.
